            <h1>An Introduction to the Basics of Data</h1>
            <h2>Written by Natrada Surachettapong</h2>
            <p style={{ marginTop: '40px' }}><b>Data</b> is information in various formats, including numbers, text, images, and video files. It can be collected, recorded, or stored to facilitate analysis, decision-making, and insights generation. Hence, understanding the data becomes crucial and highly advantageous.</p>
            <p style={{ marginTop: '20px' }}><b>Big data</b> as its name suggests, refers to data that continuously grows in size every day. As it expands exponentially over time, it becomes increasingly large in magnitude and poses challenges in terms of handling and processing. Some sources define big data as 'data in the petabyte range or higher'.</p>
            <p style={{ marginTop: '20px' }}>Big data has four dimensions that differentiate it from other forms of data, commonly known as <b>the Four V's</b> of Big Data.</p>
            <ul class="decimal-list">
                <li>
                    <p><b>Volume:</b> refers to the scale of data.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Velocity:</b> refers to the speed at which data is incoming and the ability to analyze streaming data.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Variety:</b> refers to the different forms of data, such as tables, pictures, and audio files. Different types of data require different approaches to handling and processing.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Veracity:</b> refers to the uncertainty of data, including concerns about its accuracy</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p style={{ marginTop: '40px' }}><b>Type of data</b></p>
            <ul class="decimal-list">
                <li>
                    <p><b>Structured data:</b> refers to data that possesses a well-defined format and can be conveniently represented in tabular form</p>
                    <ul class="dot-list">
                        <li>Excel</li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Semi-structured data:</b>refers to data that exhibits flexibility in its format, allowing for changes or expansions as needed. It is often represented in a key-value format, where data items are referenced using unique keys or tags. There are several benefits associated with data in this form. First, it enables the storage and management of diverse data types and sources. Moreover, accessing semi-structured data using key-value pairs can offer faster data retrieval compared to scanning through each value, as in table-structured data. This is particularly advantageous in scenarios where direct access to specific data elements is required.</p>
