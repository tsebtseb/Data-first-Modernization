            <p style={{ marginTop: '40px' }}><b>1st Wave: Infrastructure-first</b> refers to an organizational approach that prioritizes infrastructure-centric strategies, focusing on upgrading technology infrastructure components such as hardware, software, storage, and servers.</p>
            <p style={{ marginTop: '40px' }}>shift toâ€¦</p>
            <p style={{ marginTop: '40px' }}><b>2nd Wave: Data-first</b> refers to an organizational approach that prioritizes data-centric strategies, focusing on understanding insights and utilizing data to create value and drive business growth. It involves data management, data analytics, and data-driven decision-making to inform business strategies. This approach often involves integration with technology modernization, such as cloud computing, advanced analytics, and automation, to support effective data management and utilization.</p>  
            <p style={{ marginTop: '40px' }}><b>4 Steps to Data-First Modernization</b></p>
            <p style={{ marginTop: '40px' }}><b>1. Create CXO driven data strategy:</b></p>
            <p>The first step for an organization to achieve data-first modernization is for the CXO (Chief Experience Officer), a C-level executive position within the organization responsible for decision-making, to adopt a data-centric approach and process. This involves utilizing data to develop and implement business strategies that ensure appropriate adoption of analytic tools for decision-making, identifying operational areas for optimization, improving performance, and driving faster innovation.</p>
            <p style={{ marginTop: '40px' }}><b>2. Embrace data truths:</b></p>
            <p>The second step is for the company to understand the core and insights about data, recognizing its value, challenges, and rights, so that the organization can handle the data properly. Therefore, the company must realize that:</p>
            <ul class="dot-list">
                <li><b>Data is a core asset:</b> as data is the most valuable asset of the organization, the organization should properly consider it and allocate an appropriate portion of resources to it.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>Data has gravity:</b> this refers to the concept that data tends to stay in one place, which is where it originates. As a result, the processing power, services, and applications are attracted to the data due to throughput and latency, leading to data growth at its original location.
                    <p>This leads to the following <b>problems:</b></p>
                    <ul class="dot-list">
                        <li><b>Latency:</b> as data grows significantly at a specific location, it will take time for it to be accessible.</li>
                        <li><b>Non-portable:</b> as the data becomes significantly large, it becomes difficult and costly to move.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Solutions</b> to deal with these problems:</p>
                    <ul class="dot-list">
                        <li><b>Multi-cloud strategy:</b> using multiple cloud providers allows for data and processing power to be moved between providers, effectively handling data.</li>
                        <li><b>Edge computing:</b> the practice of keeping the data where it is generated and placing the data processing power in close proximity. This approach can effectively address the issue of latency, as it reduces the time required for data to be processed and accessed.</li>
                        <li><b>Replication and backup:</b> the process of replicating data and storing it in multiple locations. This ensures data availability and helps reduce the challenge of moving large amounts of data, thereby addressing the issue of non-portability.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Data has rights and sovereignty:</b> the organization must implement appropriate policies to handle data and stay updated with relevant regulations to ensure responsible data management.</li>
                <li><b>Data must be unified and available:</b> unifying data means integrating and standardizing data from different sources into a usable format, eliminating inconsistent data, data loss, and redundant data. This process involves data cleansing, data management, data mapping, data integration, and data standardization, all of which contribute to a more unified and usable dataset. Additionally, it is important to ensure that authorized individuals have access to the data when needed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style={{ marginTop: '40px' }}><b>3.Determine the ideal level of data-first maturity:</b></p>
            <p>The third step for the organization is to determine the desired level of data-first maturity.</p>
            <p><b>Data maturity</b> refers to the stage of development and growth in an organization's approach to data management and utilization. In short, it determines how data-driven the organization is.</p>
